                    The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that could offer space distribution between items in an interface and powerful alignment capabilities. This article gives an outline of the main features of flexbox, which we will be exploring in more detail in the rest of these guides.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When we describe flexbox as being one dimensional we are describing the fact that flexbox deals with layout in one dimension at a time — either as a row or as a column. This can be contrasted with the two-dimensional model of CSS Grid Layout, which controls columns and rows together.

            <article>
                <p>
                    When working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes — the main axis and the cross axis. The main axis is defined by the <code>flex-direction</code> property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it. Everything we do with flexbox refers back to these axes, so it is worth understanding how they work from the outset.
                </p>
                <h2>The main axis</h2>
                <p>The main axis is defined by <code>flex-direction</code>, which has four possible values:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>row</code></li>
                    <li><code>row-reverse</code></li>
                    <li><code>column</code></li>
                    <li><code>column-reverse</code></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Should you choose <code>row</code> or <code>row-reverse</code>, your main axis will run along the row in the inline direction.</p>
                <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox/basics1.png" alt="If flex-direction is set to row the main axis runs along the row in the inline direction.">
                <p>Choose <code>column</code> or <code>column-reverse</code> and your main axis will run from the top of the page to the bottom — in the block direction.</p>

                <h2>The cross axis</h2>
                <p>The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis, therefore if your <code>flex-direction</code> (main axis) is set to <code>row</code> or <code>row-reverse</code> the cross axis runs down the columns.</p>

                <p>If your main axis is column or column-reverse then the cross axis runs along the rows.</p>

            <article>
                <p>Another vital area of understanding is how flexbox makes no assumption about the writing mode of the document. In the past, CSS was heavily weighted towards horizontal and left-to-right writing modes. Modern layout methods encompass the range of writing modes and so we no longer assume that a line of text will start at the top left of a document and run towards the right-hand side, with new lines appearing one under the other.</p>
                <p>You can read more about the relationship between flexbox and the Writing Modes specification in a later article; however, the following description should help explain why we do not talk about left and right and top and bottom when we describe the direction that our flex items flow in.</p>
                <p>If the <code>flex-direction</code> is <code>row</code> and I am working in English, then the start edge of the main axis will be on the left, the end edge on the right.</p>
                <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox/basics5.png" alt="Working in English the start edge is on the left.">
                <p>If I were to work in Arabic, then the start edge of my main axis would be on the right and the end edge on the left.</p>
                <img src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox/basics6.png" alt="The start edge in a RTL language is on the right.">
                <p>In both cases the start edge of the cross axis is at the top of the flex container and the end edge at the bottom, as both languages have a horizontal writing mode.</p>
                <p>After a while, thinking about start and end rather than left and right becomes natural, and will be useful to you when dealing with other layout methods such as CSS Grid Layout which follow the same patterns.</p>

            <header id="Header4">The flex container</header>
            <article>
                <p>An area of a document laid out using flexbox is called a flex container. To create a flex container, we set the value of the area's container's <code>display</code> property to <code>flex</code> or <code>inline-flex</code>. As soon as we do this the direct children of that container become flex items. As with all properties in CSS, some initial values are defined, so when creating a flex container all of the contained flex items will behave in the following way.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Items display in a row (the <code>flex-direction</code> property's default is row).</li>
                    <li>The items start from the start edge of the main axis.</li>
                    <li>The items do not stretch on the main dimension, but can shrink.</li>
                    <li>The items will stretch to fill the size of the cross axis.</li>
                    <li>The <code>flex-basis</code> property is set to <code>auto</code>.</li>
                    <li>The <code>flex-wrap</code> property is set to <code>nowrap</code>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The result of this is that your items will all line up in a row, using the size of the content as their size in the main axis. If there are more items than can fit in the container, they will not wrap but will instead overflow. If some items are taller than others, all items will stretch along the cross axis to fill its full size.</p>
                <h2>Changing flex-direction</h2>
                <p>Adding the <code>flex-direction</code> property to the flex container allows us to change the direction in which our flex items display. Setting <code>flex-direction: row-reverse</code> will keep the items displaying along the row, however the start and end lines are switched.</p>
                <p>If we change <code>flex-direction</code> to <code>column</code> the main axis switches and our items now display in a column. Set <code>column-reverse</code> and the start and end lines are again switched.</p>
